A horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in an individual's navel.
A bubble chart displaying each sample's microbial data, with marker size representing sample values and marker colors corresponding to OTU IDs.
Demographic information about the selected individual.
